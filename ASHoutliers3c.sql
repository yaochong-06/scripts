-- Returns sampled events from V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY whose time_waited
-- exceeds a given significance level as determined using V$EVENT_HISTOGRAM
-- as follows:
--
-- 1) Each histogram time_waited bucket is assigned a significance using:
-- BUCKET_SIGNIFICANCE = SUM(wait count in this and higher buckets)
--                       / SUM(wait count for all buckets)
--
-- 2) Join to V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY by time_waited to assign significance
-- to events and filter for events with significance > :siglevel (input variable)
--
-- Useful filter values:   0.99 <= :siglevel < 1.0
-- (higher values filter out more events)
